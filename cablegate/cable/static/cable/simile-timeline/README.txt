  What is this?
  -------------

  Timeline is a web widget for visualizing temporal data.


  Running Timeline
  ----------------

  Timeline consists entirely of static files (javascript libraries,
  image files and css files). All you really need is to
  serve those resources off a web server without having to install
  any special server side functionality. Therefore any web server will do.

  Two ways to access the library:
  
  1. If you have a web server running your machine:
  
     a) install the Java runtime from Sun if your OS doesn't have it already
        (get it for free at http://www.java.com)
     b) install Apache Ant (get it for free at http://ant.apache.org)
     c) Open a shell or command prompt in the same directory of this file and type:

      > ant
      
     Ant will use the 'build.xml' configuration file to construct and the script will copy all the required files in the give path.
     
  2. No web server? The timeline project includes a small webserver to get you started:
  
     a) install the Java runtime from Sun if your OS doesn't have it already
        (get it for free at http://www.java.com)
     b) Open a shell or command prompt in the same directory of this file and type:
  
      [win32]> run
      [unix/macosx]> ./run

     and then point your browser to
  
      http://127.0.0.1:9999/timeline/
